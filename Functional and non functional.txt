Non Functional Requirement :

1)Reliability:
   Create a requirement that data created in the system will be retained for a number of years without the data being changed by the system.It’s a 
  good idea to also include requirements that make it easier to monitor system performance.

2)Performance:
    What should system response times be, as measured from any point, under what circumstances? Are there specific peak times when the load on the 
  system will be unusually high?Think of stress periods, for example, at the end of the month or in conjunction with payroll disbursement.

3)Supportability:
   The system needs to be cost-effective to maintain.Maintainability requirements may cover diverse levels of documentation, such as system 
  documentation, as well as test documentation, e.g. which test cases and test plans will accompany the system.

4)Security :
   Privacy of information, the export of restricted technologies, intellectual property rights, etc. should be audited.
